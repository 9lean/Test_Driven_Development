# A practical guide to Test Driven Development (TDD)
*Test Driven Development is a way of writing quality code during Software Development. Its one of the well known and widely adopted practice of eXtreme Programming(XP). Its used on the preamble of Test First approach which ultimately increase the quality of the output code*

## TDD and C++ 
*Test Driven Development (TDD) is not associated with any specific languages and can be done in any languages. C++ is used here as a reference language to explain the working of TDD*

## [Module - 0 : Understanding TDD](https://github.com/9lean/Test_Driven_Development/tree/master/Understanding%20TDD)

*This module will explain what is meant by TDD and how its done*

## [Module - 1 : The AAA(Arrange-Act-Assert) of Unit Tests](https://github.com/9lean/Test_Driven_Development/tree/master/AAA%20Of%20Tests)

*This module will explain how AAA (Arrange-Act-Assert) is used in writing unit tests and what will be its impact on TDD*

## [Module - 2 : Sample Unit Testing example in C++](https://github.com/9lean/Test_Driven_Development/tree/master/Sample%20Unit%20Testing%20Code)

*This module will explain the usage of TDD using C++ Google Test Framework.*

## [Module -3  : A Sample implementation of TDD](https://github.com/9lean/Test_Driven_Development/tree/master/Sample%20TDD%20Code)

*This module will demonstrate writing of TDD code in series of steps (9 to be precise)*
